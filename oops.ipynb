    "## Everything is an object in Python\n",
    "There's a fair chance you've heard this if you've tried to learn Python. Especially so if you're coming from another language. And it's true. Most \"things\", be they integers, functions, etc. in Python are objects of some class or the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is as opposed to something like C, where e.g. functions are just sections of code with known addresses. Because Python functions are objects, you can do stuff like assign them to variables, store them in lists and dictionaries, pass them as arguments to other functions, return them from functions etc. The closest functionality you can get to this in C is through function pointers-- pointers to the memory address of the first instruction of a function.\n",
    "But not through functions themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the flexibility afforded by this OOP-driven approach, we're going to start with `int` and slowly add features until it resembles a `Generator` (don't worry if you don't know what that is).\n",
